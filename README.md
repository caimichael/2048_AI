This project is my attempt to create an effective artificial intelligence
for solving the 2048 logic puzzle using Python. 

It's my first independent project, so feel free to submit revisions, I'd 
love the feedback. 

Later iterations of this project will allow the user to choose which 
block to stop at (i.e. stop at 1024) so that they can continue solving
from there on their own.
